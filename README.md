## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the details tag again and how to use the scale tag in sizing svg's.

### Continued development

I plan to use this as a reference for my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools Details Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_details.asp) - This helped me figure out how to use the details tag after a while of not using it.
- [W3Schools Details Tag Open Attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/TagS/att_details_open.asp) - This helped me figure out what attribute to use for the selector to toggle the icons for the summary tag.
